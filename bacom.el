;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file defines dynamic completion hooks for shell-mode and
;; shell-command prompts that are based on Bash completion.
;;
;; You will need shell-command.el to get tab completion in the
;; minibuffer. See http://www.namazu.org/~tsuchiya/elisp/shell-command.el
;;
;; Bash completion for emacs:
;; - is aware of Bash builtins, aliases and functions
;; - does file expansion inside of colon-separated variables
;;   and after redirections (> or <)
;; - escapes special characters when expanding file names
;; - is configurable through programmable Bash completion
;;
;; A simpler and more complete alternative to bacom.el is to
;; run a Bash shell in a buffer in term mode(M-x `ansi-term').
;; Unfortunately, many Emacs editing features are not available when
;; running in term mode.  Also, term mode is not available in
;; shell-command prompts.
;;
;; INSTALLATION
;;
;; 1. copy bacom.el into a directory that's on Emacs load-path
;; 2. add this into your .emacs file:
;;   (autoload 'bacom-dynamic-complete \"bacom\"
;;     \"Bash completion hook\")
;;   (add-hook 'shell-dynamic-complete-functions
;;      'bacom-dynamic-complete)
;;   (add-hook 'shell-command-complete-functions
;;      'bacom-dynamic-complete)
;;
;;   or simpler, but forces you to load this file at startup:
;;
;;   (require 'bacom)
;;   (bacom-setup)
;;
;; 3. reload your .emacs (M-x `eval-buffer') or restart
;;
;; 4. Set `comint-prompt-regexp' to match your Bash prompt, regardless
;;    of the value of `comint-use-prompt-regexp'.  This is needed by
;;    `comint-redirect', the library used for getting the completions
;;    from the underlying shell process.
;;
;; Once this is done, use <TAB> as usual to do dynamic completion from
;; shell mode or a shell command minibuffer, such as the one started
;; for M-x `compile'.
;;
;; You'll get better results if you turn on Bash's programmable completion.
;; On Ubuntu, this means running:
;;   sudo apt-get install bash-completion
;; and then adding this to your .bashrc:
;;   . /etc/bash_completion
;;
;; Right after enabling Bash's programmable completion, and whenever you
;; make changes to you .bashrc, call `bacom-reset' to make
;; sure Bash completion takes your new settings into account.
;;
;; CAVEATS
;;
;; Using the underlying Shell process for doing the completion has some
;; important disadvantages:
;; - Bash completion is slower than standard Emacs completion.
;; - the first completion can take a bit longer, since a table of
;;   available Bash completions needs to be initialized.
;; - The variable `comint-prompt-regexp' hast be set to the
;;   correct prompt for your Shell.
;;
;; COMPATIBILITY
;;
;; bacom.el is quite sensitive to the OS and Bash version.
;; This package is known to work on the following environment:
;;   GNU Emacs 22.3.1 (Aquamacs 1.7)
;;   GNU Emacs 22.1.1 (OSX 10.5)
;;   GNU Emacs 22.1.1 (Ubuntu 8.04)
;;   GNU Emacs 23.0.94.1 (Ubuntu 8.10)
;;   GNU Emacs 24.1.1 (OSX 10.7)
;;   GNU Emacs 24.1.1 (OSX 10.8)
;;   GNU Emacs 24.3
;;
;; and using the following Bash versions:
;;   Bash 2.05.08
;;   Bash 3.2.17
;;   Bash 3.2.32
;;   Bash 3.2.39
;;
;; bacom.el does not works on XEmacs.

;;; History:
;;
;; 2013-05-27   Emilio Lopes <eclig@gmx.net>
;;
;; * Use Comint's "redirect" functionality to run completion commands.
;;
;; 2009-11-25   Stephane Zermatten <szermatt@gmail.com>
;;
;; * bacom-require-process: set MAILCHECK to -1
;; to disable mail check message.
;;
;; 2009-08-01   Stephane Zermatten <szermatt@gmail.com>
;;
;; * bacom-generate-line: add missing compgen
;; option to complete commands (duh!).
